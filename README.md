# Project--Image_Classification_using_SVM


## it's basically a multiclass problem

### Problem -->

SVM is binary Classifier and here we need to do muti class classification

### Solution -->

we have two approaches to solve the classification problems

 * one vs one
 * one vs rest
 
we are not using one vs one method here because we have a large dataset and this method has time complexity O(N*2).

so, we are going to use one vs rest method.

### Learning Goals
 * how to read different images from a directory 
 * How to implement One-vs-one Multiclass classification
 * How to use SVM fo image classification
